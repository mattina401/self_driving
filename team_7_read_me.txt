Requirements
============

Java 8 is required to run the Self Driving Simulator.


Running
=======

The Self Driving Simulator can be run one of two ways:
$ java -jar self_driving_car_sim.jar 
This will run the default settings file 
however the default settings file is not configured correctly.
It is better to use one of the team's configuration files:

$ java -jar self_driving_car_sim.jar intersection.txt
or:
$ java -jar self_driving_car_sim.jar overview_config.txt

Alternative you can execute one of the convenience batch files
which does the same thing but is shorter to type in:

$ ./run_intersection.sh
or:
$ ./run_overview.sh
